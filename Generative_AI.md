#  Generative AI

 Use of Generative AI in This Project
 
Introduction
Generative AI tools, like OpenAI's GPT models, helped in many ways throughout this project. They made data analysis, hypothesis testing, documentation, and visualization faster and more efficient. AI improved how insights were generated, helped clean and organize data, and suggested better ways to present findings.

How AI Was Used

âœ… 1. Documentation Support
AI helped structure the project documentation, making reporting and note-taking easier.

ðŸ”¹ Template Creation: AI-generated ready-to-use templates for different sections of the project, such as AI usage, ethics, and methodology.

Example Prompt:

"Generate markdown documentation for generative AI and ethics, including introduction, applications, coding help, business requirements, data insights, and legal considerations."

ðŸ”¹ Benefit: This saved time, allowing more focus on actual data analysis.

âœ… 2. Coding Assistance
AI helped write and improve code for data processing, cleaning, and visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning: AI suggested methods for handling missing values and fixing inconsistent formats.
ðŸ”¹ Statistical Testing: AI recommended T-tests and correlation analysis to validate hypotheses.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization: AI suggested the best charts (e.g., bar plots, scatter plots, and box plots) to present findings.

ðŸ”¹ Example: AI helped create a function to fill missing values using the median of the dataset.

âœ… 3. Generating Insights

AI provided guidance on how to analyze and test hypotheses effectively.

ðŸ”¹ Example Hypotheses & AI-Suggested Methods:

âœ” Do happiness scores differ by region? â†’ AI suggested T-tests & bar charts

âœ” Does GDP per capita affect happiness? â†’ AI suggested scatter plots & correlation analysis

âœ” Has happiness changed between 2020 and 2024? â†’ AI suggested line plots & histograms


âœ… 4. Data Storytelling & Dashboard Design

AI helped improve how data was presented to different audiences.

ðŸ”¹ Dashboard Suggestions: AI recommended how to arrange charts, graphs, and maps to make insights easier to understand.
ðŸ”¹ Improved Storytelling: AI provided ideas on how to explain findings in a simple way for both technical and non-technical audiences.
ðŸ”¹ Bias Identification: AI pointed out potential data biases and suggested additional comparisons (e.g., economic differences across regions).

Ethical Considerations

AI's role in the project was fully documented to ensure transparency.

âœ” AI-generated code and insights were always reviewed and validated against actual data.

âœ” AI helped, but final decisions were made by human analysis, ensuring accurate interpretations.

Benefits & Limitations of AI
-Benefits:

Saved time on repetitive tasks (e.g., documentation, data cleaning).
Suggested alternative methods for analysis and visualization.
Improved storytelling by helping to frame findings clearly.
-Limitations:

Needed human editing to refine AI-generated content.
AI could not replace expert judgmentâ€”all AI recommendations were reviewed for accuracy.

Conclusion
AI was a valuable tool in this project, making processes faster and more efficient. It helped with data cleaning, hypothesis testing, visualization, and documentation. However, human validation was always necessary to ensure meaningful insights. By combining AI's speed with expert analysis, we were able to extract valuable insights from the World Happiness dataset effectively.
