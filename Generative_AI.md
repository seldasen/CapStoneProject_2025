 Use of Generative AI in This Project

Introduction
Generative AI tools, including OpenAI's GPT models, were leveraged throughout this project to enhance data analysis, hypothesis testing, documentation, and visual storytelling. These tools played a crucial role in accelerating insights generation, optimizing code, and refining the analytical approach.

Applications of AI

Documentation

AI-assisted documentation was a key aspect of this project, allowing for structured reporting and efficient note-taking. This freed up more time for in-depth data analysis.

Template Generation:AI was used to generate markdown documentation templates for generative AI, ethics, and project methodologies.

Prompt: "Please generate documentation templates in markdown for generative AI and ethics. The generative AI section should include introduction, applications, documentation, coding help, business requirements, data insights, design thinking, validation methods, and pros and cons. The ethics section should cover data privacy, bias, legal considerations, and reflections."

Output:AI provided structured documentation templates, which were adapted to align with the specific needs of this project.

Code Assistance

Generative AI tools supported coding tasks, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing – AI-assisted in handling missing values, renaming columns, and standardizing formats.

Statistical testing – AI provided suggestions for hypothesis validation, including the use of t-tests and correlation analysis.

Visualization suggestions – AI recommended bar plots, histograms, and box plots for effectively presenting findings.

Example: Handling Missing Data
For missing data imputation, AI-assisted in generating a function to fill missing values with the median of the dataset.

Example: Hypothesis Testing
AI recommended using Pearson’s correlation test to analyze the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness score and helped refine the statistical approach.

Insights Generation

Hypothesis Validation:
AI suggested appropriate visualizations and statistical methods for evaluating our hypotheses, such as:

Happiness scores differ significantly between regions – Suggested t-tests and bar charts.

GDP per capita correlates with happiness – Suggested scatter plots and Pearson correlation.

Social support impacts happiness – Suggested correlation analysis and trend analysis.

Happiness scores have changed over time (2020 vs 2024) – Suggested histograms and line plots.

Visual Storytelling & Design Thinking

AI played a crucial role in:

Dashboard design recommendations – Suggested effective ways to visualize happiness trends for stakeholders.

Enhancing storytelling – Provided insights on how to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Exploring alternative perspectives – Highlighted potential biases in the data and suggested additional comparisons, such as the impact of regional economic differences on happiness scores.

Ethical Review of AI Use

AI usage was transparently documented in the project report, with clear explanations of how AI contributed to code generation, statistical insights, and visualization recommendations. All AI-generated outputs were validated against actual data to ensure accuracy.

Benefits and Limitations

Benefits:

Increased efficiency – AI reduced the time spent on repetitive tasks such as documentation and data cleaning.

Enhanced analysis – AI suggested alternative approaches for hypothesis testing and visualization.

Improved storytelling – Helped frame findings in a clear and compelling way.

Limitations:

Contextual editing required – Some AI-generated suggestions needed refinement to align with the specific dataset.

Over-reliance on statistical outputs – AI-generated recommendations were validated with domain knowledge to ensure meaningful interpretation.

Conclusion

Generative AI played a vital role in streamlining various aspects of this project, from data processing and hypothesis testing to visualization and documentation. By integrating AI tools effectively, we were able to enhance productivity and extract meaningful insights from the World Happiness Report dataset while maintaining a rigorous analytical approach.
